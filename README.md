## 🔒 Cybersecurity Projects

- **[🖥️ Active Directory Home Lab](https://github.com/Ajimenez-p/ActiveDirectoryHomeLab)**  

  **🛠 Technical Stack:**  
  - Windows Server 2022, Splunk Enterprise, Sysmon, Kali Linux, Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS, Windows 10 Pro, Oracle VirtualBox

  **🌟 Key Competencies:**  
  - Active Directory Domain Configuration and Management  
  - Network Security and Firewall Configuration  
  - Advanced Logging and Monitoring with Splunk and Sysmon  
  - Threat Simulation and Penetration Testing (Brute-Force RDP Attacks)  
  - Vulnerability Assessment and Incident Response  

  **📋 Project Overview:**  
   - Developed a realistic Active Directory home lab environment using VirtualBox to simulate a corporate network. Configured Windows Server 2022 as a domain controller with Active Directory Domain Services and DNS. Integrated Splunk on Ubuntu Server for SIEM capabilities and installed Sysmon for advanced system logging. Simulated security threats using Kali Linux, including brute-force RDP attacks and Atomic Red Team techniques, to evaluate defenses and refine incident response strategies. Enhanced the lab's security posture by revising policies, implementing account lockouts, and restricting RDP access.

  **🔑 Key Highlights:**  
  - 🗂️ Configured Organizational Units (OUs), Group Policy Objects (GPOs), and multi-role user accounts.  
  - 🔗 Installed and configured Splunk Universal Forwarders for log collection and transmission.  
  - 📊 Conducted network telemetry analysis and created real-time security alerts in Splunk dashboards.  
  - 🛡️ Hardened the environment through iterative vulnerability assessments and security remediation.
